# hgsModel
This is a class to interface for the Hydrogeosphere modelling system (aquanty.com). The usage is shown in test.m
feel free to send additions or updates to be included in the program.

Sometimes, it is much easier to interact with the model in matlab. The interface reads binary output files so the post processing step is not needed.
